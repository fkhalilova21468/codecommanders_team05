          On the 6th of November 2024, our team of 4 ran a coding event – "Hour
          of Code". It took place in secondary school number 240 in Nasimi
          district. A total of 20 students from the 6th grade attended the
          event.

          First, we presented informative slides about our background and Ada
          University, especially the School of IT and Engineering.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The students did not have a background in coding; however, were very
          excited to learn about it. After a little theoretical lecture,
          participants started solving the “Minecraft” themed coding exercises
          hosted on the code.org website.During the event, we divided the job
          into several roles: presenting, technical assistance, and helping
          students with coding exercises. Through these interactive exercises,
          students explored programming concepts such as sequencing, control
          flow, and loops.

          To make the learning process even more interactive, we encouraged the
          most successful students to help their stuck classmates or to explain
          the solution in front of the whole class.Thanks to this policy, we did
          not have many students who performed significantly worse than others
          or were left behind. Also, as team members we were always ready to
          give hints and assist with any problems. Overall, by the end of the
          event, people successfully finished approximately 2 3ds of the course,
          and they were informed that they can later continue coding on the
          website as they wish. After everyone had a basic understanding of
          common instructions and how they could be placed in a sequence, nobody
          had a lot of struggles with any particular coding exercise.

          At the end of the Hour of Code, every participant received a
          certificate for completing The Houf of Code and demonstrating an
          understanding of the basic concepts of Computer Science. Students had
          a feeling of accomplishment since they were working hard for an hour
          crunching new programming concepts. Despite initial challenges and
          some technical issues, the students enjoyed the activities, and many
          showed potential for further exploration in programming. We left the
          event feeling fulfilled, knowing we had sparked curiosity in the
          students. After all certificates were handed out, we all gathered to
          take a group photo. Both participants and organizers received positive
          emotions and were feeling good about themselves. This experience
          taught us valuable lessons in planning, problem-solving, and teamwork.
