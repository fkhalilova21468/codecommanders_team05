          My name is Nazli Nasirli, a 17-year-old Mathematics major student at
          ADA University. I am passionate about solving complex problems and
          exploring the beauty of logic through math. In addition to my studies,
          I have a deep love for painting, which allows me to express myself
          creatively and find inspiration in the world around me. Painting
          teaches me patience and perspective, skills I carry into every aspect
          of my life. I am excited to continue combining my passions to grow
          both intellectually and artistically.
